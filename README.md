# noscroll
Noscroll is a chrome extension that forces you to lock in and make Github commits instead of doomscrolling on sites.

## Local development

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kashsuks/noscroll
```

After that, you can edit the files as needed.

If you want to test the code you wrote:

- Go to your browser (Chrome is preferred)
- Go to the extensions manager
- Enable developer mode
- Load unpacked
- Selected the folder `noscroll` from wherever it was cloned into
- Test!
